## üß† Techniques Implemented

### ‚úÖ Scalability

1. **Load Balancing**:  
   NGINX is configured to route requests to services. Although we use one instance for each service here, the setup supports multiple instances for horizontal scaling.

2. **Horizontal Scaling (Mocked)**:  
   Simulated by containerizing services using Docker Compose. You can spin up multiple instances of `product-service` and `review-service` to simulate scaling.

### ‚úÖ Resilience

1. **Retry with Fallback**:  
   When the review service fails or times out, the product service retries 3 times before falling back to static/dummy data via a fallback method.
